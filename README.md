Info 343 Files Challenge - Quincy Pham

Hi Zach!

I hope we start off great in this class and continue great until the end! Good luck with grading, so many students; I'll try my best to finish ahead of time and ease up your grading load instead of piling up until the end of the quarter!

Best Wishes,
- Quincy
