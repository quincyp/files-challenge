                <H1>Welcome to a brief page of Batman!</H1>

                <p>The fictional character I chose is Batman. Batman is a DC comics anti-hero from the dark city of Gotham. Although an "anti-hero" Batman is opposed to killing and guns; instead he pushes towards justice. As a billionaire Batman is able to use his resources on gadgets to help stop crime in the steets as Batman, but during the daytime he is Bruce Wayne and uses those resources to help support the community.</p>

                <p>Batman can be found in many of DC comics. Comics may be entitled: <a href="http://dccomics.com/characters/batman">The Batman. The Dark Knight. The Caped Crusader. The World's Greatest Detective.</a></p>
